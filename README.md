# Project : CALCULATOR
# Author : Krish Chaudhary

- It is designed to perform mathematical calculations efficiently and accurately. Typically,
it includes a user interface where users can input numbers and operators  (such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division) using  graphical buttons.
- The calculator then processes the input and displays the result on the screen.

- I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to build this.
